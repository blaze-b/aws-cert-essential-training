### Cloud computing deployment models

- When someone refers to "the cloud" in the context of a shared or public cloud, they are referring to on-demand infrastructure provided by a vendor, such as AWS

- Organizations that use the public cloud might take advantage of further solutions provided by a cloud services provider, such as one or any combination of the following:

    1. Software as a service (SaaS)
    2. Platform as a service (PaaS)
    3. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
